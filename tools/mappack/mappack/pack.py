``layer_bytes`` exists so the renderer can skip a layer without walking its
varints: it draws filled areas for every visible tile first, then strokes, so
a lake in one tile cannot paint over a road in its neighbour.

Coordinates are tile-local in a 0..EXTENT grid, allowed to run slightly
negative / past EXTENT because geometry is clipped with a small buffer so
strokes do not end abruptly at tile seams.

#: Share of a tile's point budget reserved for minor roads.
#:
#: The same starvation as AREA_BUDGET_SHARE, one level down. Features are taken
#: in importance order, and a primary is 90 against a residential's 45, so in a
#: dense tile the majors spend the budget before a single side street is
#: considered. Measured on a downloadable Berlin: residential roads came to
#: 2.6% of kept points, 220 features for everything inside the Ringbahn, while
#: primary and secondary took 77% between them. That is a map of arterials with
#: nothing to navigate by once you leave one.
#:
#: This is a floor rather than a cap, so it is spent as a ceiling on everything
#: else: areas and major roads share `major_budget`, minors draw on whatever
#: remains. Nothing is wasted when a tile has no minor roads in it, because the
#: total budget is still the binding constraint.
#:
